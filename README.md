This is a semi-endless runner game, with procedurally generated obstacle placement, gradually increasing difficulty, and several powerups to pick up.

The powerups include:
  - Slow Mo -- slows the game down for 6 seconds
  - Shield -- makes the player invincible for one hit
  - Jump -- launches the character into the air to avoid obstacles

The game is published on Itch (for free!), with an installer to create a Desktop shortcut. You can download it or view the gameplay video at this link: https://ranjansikand.itch.io/blockdown

Note:
This repository includes a build of the game, and all of the scripts used to control game assets; however, it is missing a few of the assets themselves, to prevent people from turning it in as a homework assignment.
